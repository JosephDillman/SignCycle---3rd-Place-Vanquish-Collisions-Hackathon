### If you are a recruiter please don't judge the code  quality it was a hackathon :)

The Vanquish Collisions Hackathon attracted over 100 hackers to UBC, sponsored by the City of Vancouver seeking to reduce traffic collisions.

12.6% of bicycle accidents occur when drivers make a right hand turn and collide with bikers approaching from behind. So we made a road sign equip with a motion sensor that notifies drivers of bikers coming down a lane from behind.
